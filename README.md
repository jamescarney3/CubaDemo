# CubaDemo
Simple application for practice and testing purposes with Cuba, Rack, and jQuery

## What is this thing?
This is just a demo project I started in order to explore some of the functionalities
of the Cuba (non-)framework and Rack in the context of a simple, single-page app.

## What's it for?
It's mostly for me hack, break, fix, and test whatever pops into my head. Some of
those things are impulsive and randomly generated, and some of those things are
features I want to implement in other projects; in any case, they all have to
coexist peacefully.
